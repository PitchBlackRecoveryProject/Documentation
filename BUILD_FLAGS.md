# MAINTAINER := "Rokib Hasan @fr3akyphantom" # Example, keep it short
```

dm-verity is enabled by default in PBRP, this build flag disables that by default.
```makefile
PB_DISABLE_DEFAULT_DM_VERITY := true
```

### Disable treble compatibility check by default

```makefile
PB_DISABLE_DEFAULT_TREBLE_COMP := true
```

```makefile
PB_FORCE_DD_FLASH := TRUE
```
