# Collaborators - PBRP

Collaborators are the set of developers/designers/themers who have already contributed to PBRP in some way or another. These set of people are very important to PBRP and therefore, gives some extra privileges than external contributors.

## Roles

- Collaborators can directly manage and add new devices to PBRP. (For official maintainership, file PR with test results)
- Collaborators can develop new feature/bug-fix for PBRP under developer's review.
- Collaborators can sometimes assist developers in some feature/theme/bug-fix.

## Pushing Conventions

All the collaborators are required to first work on a seperate branch and then create a PR with a review of atleast one developer to push commits to mainstream branches.
