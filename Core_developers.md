# Core Developers - PBRP

Core Developers are the backbone of PBRP and making a better environment for them is very important.

## Roles

- Developers have the full control over every repository inside the organizaion but critical actions should always be reviewed by atleast 1 fellow core developers.
- Core Developers will directly manage device maintainers and collaborators by giving inputs regarding any updates/bugs/features.
- Communication plays a vital role for a Core Developer as he has to share every information to their fellow developers so that everyone is well aware what's going on and how to manage maintainers down the line.


## Pushing Conventions for GREEN Repositories

Developer can directly commit to GREEN repositories, without the intervention of the maintainer. But it's equally important to notify the maintainer as soon as you commit.
