# Documentation for PitchBlack Recovery Project
> A set of documents which will help developers to know about our project and contribute on it.

### Introduction

The organization consists of specific [Core developers](Core_developers.md). Make sure to know their roles.

Anybody who can maintain new device builds can directly contact Core developers in [Telegram Group](https://t.me/pbrpcom).

Developers should see [Bringup Instructions](BRINGUP.md) if they want to be the first to make a PitchBlack Recovery for their device.

Maintainers as-well-as Developers should see [BUILDING Instructions](BUILDING_Instructions.md) to know more about the build-and-release system. Core developers can set a new CI Autobuild system onto your device tree if already not available for helping you to release continuous updates.

Aside from Core developers and Device maintainers, anybody who contributed to our organization in some way or another, are known as [Collaborators](Collaborators.md).


### This Document tries to explain everything you need to know about our project and how to contribute to it.

---

This Organization has a few repository on that only Core Developers can push changes, and there are many device-specific repositories on which maintainers can push their changes.

### We have separated the repositories into two classes for your easy understanding.

1. [RED Repositories](RED_Repositories.md)
> Core Organization Repositories
2. [GREEN Repositories](GREEN_Repositories.md)
> Device-specific Repositories
